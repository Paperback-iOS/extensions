# Extensions

Default tracker extensions for [Paperback](https://paperback.moe/) 0.8.

Tracking helps you automatically send read manga chapters to supported trackers, so you can keep track of what and when you read it online.

Paperback does not officially support source extensions (extensions with content), so you will not find any in this repository.
